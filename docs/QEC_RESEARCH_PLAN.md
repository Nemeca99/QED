# QEC Research Plan: Theory-Driven Data Collection

## üéØ Research Philosophy

**Theory First, Data Second**: We design our experiments around specific testable hypotheses rather than collecting data blindly. This ensures our computational resources are used efficiently and our results are interpretable.

## üìã Research Hypotheses

### H1: Opening Determinism Hypothesis
**Theory**: The first legal move collapses the entire entangled configuration tree; therefore early moves carry exponentially greater impact on outcome probability.

**Prediction**: Win-rate variance after move 1 should be larger than after any other single move.

**Data Needed**:
- `first_move_notation`
- `first_move_eval_delta`
- `move_1_win_rate_variance`
- `move_2_win_rate_variance`
- `move_3_win_rate_variance`

**Test Method**: Compare win-rate variance by move number across large sample (1000+ games)

---

### H2: Free-Pawn Centrality
**Theory**: The location of the free pawn drives the overall mobility and tempo of the side that owns it. Certain free-pawn files (e.g., central vs. wing) will statistically correlate with higher win rates.

**Prediction**: Central free pawns (d/e files) will correlate with higher win rates than wing pawns (a/h files).

**Data Needed**:
- `white_free_pawn_file`
- `black_free_pawn_file`
- `free_pawn_centrality_score`
- `mobility_metrics`
- `tempo_metrics`

**Test Method**: Correlate free pawn file with win rate and mobility metrics

---

### H3: Information-Asymmetry Effect
**Theory**: Knowing your own free pawn gives you hidden information. Players who can leverage this asymmetry faster‚Äîby forcing discovery of the opponent's free pawn‚Äîgain a measurable early advantage.

**Prediction**: Games where one side discovers opponent's free pawn earlier will show measurable advantage for the discovering side.

**Data Needed**:
- `free_pawn_discovery_ply`
- `discovery_side`
- `eval_after_discovery`
- `information_advantage_metrics`

**Test Method**: Track when each side's free pawn is revealed, correlate with outcomes

---

### H4: Second-Player Advantage Hypothesis
**Theory**: Because player 2 can see and react to player 1's entanglement activation before moving, the second player may have a higher expected evaluation after the opening phase.

**Prediction**: Black (second player) will show higher average evaluation after opening phase (moves 1-10).

**Data Needed**:
- `opening_phase_evals`
- `first_player_entanglement_activation`
- `second_player_reaction_time`
- `eval_after_opening`
- `color_advantage_metrics`

**Test Method**: Compare average evaluations by color after opening phase

---

### H5: Entanglement Stability vs. Breakage
**Theory**: Longer-lasting entanglement networks might correlate with control, while rapid breakage could correlate with tactical volatility.

**Prediction**: Games with stable entanglement (fewer breaks) will be longer and more positional, while rapid breakage correlates with shorter, more tactical games.

**Data Needed**:
- `entanglement_break_count`
- `entanglement_persistence_ratio`
- `game_length`
- `tactical_vs_positional_score`
- `entanglement_stability_metrics`

**Test Method**: Correlate entanglement stability with game characteristics

---

### H6: Reactive-Check Survival Bias
**Theory**: Games in which kings are forced to REACT multiple times will tend to shorten; you can measure how many reactive checks occur before the losing side collapses.

**Prediction**: Games with more reactive checks will be shorter, and there's a threshold number of reactive checks that predicts game end.

**Data Needed**:
- `reactive_check_count`
- `reactive_check_sequence`
- `reactive_check_survival_rate`
- `collapse_prediction_metrics`

**Test Method**: Track reactive check sequences and correlate with game outcomes

---

### H7: Archetype-Entanglement Interaction
**Theory**: Different playing styles (archetypes) will interact differently with entanglement rules, creating distinct gameplay patterns.

**Prediction**: Tactical archetypes will benefit more from entanglement breakage, while positional archetypes will prefer stable entanglement.

**Data Needed**:
- `archetype_style`
- `entanglement_interaction_patterns`
- `archetype_win_rate_by_entanglement_type`
- `style_entanglement_correlation`

**Test Method**: Compare archetype performance across different entanglement scenarios

---

### H8: Forced-Move Cascade Effect
**Theory**: Forced moves create cascading effects that amplify tactical complexity and reduce game predictability.

**Prediction**: Games with more forced moves will show higher evaluation volatility and more tactical complexity.

**Data Needed**:
- `forced_move_count`
- `forced_move_cascade_length`
- `evaluation_volatility`
- `tactical_complexity_score`
- `game_predictability_metrics`

**Test Method**: Measure forced move patterns and correlate with game characteristics

## üî¨ Experimental Design

### Phase 1: Data Collection (1000+ games)
```bash
# Run comprehensive hypothesis testing
python qec_hypothesis_tester.py --archetypes "Carlsen-like,Tal-like,Karpov-like,Hypermodern,Defensive" --games 1000
```

**Target Metrics**:
- 1000+ games with full hypothesis data
- All 38 required data fields collected
- Per-ply JSONL logging for detailed analysis

### Phase 2: Statistical Analysis
```bash
# Analyze collected data
python analyze_qec_data.py --logs_dir hypothesis_test_logs --create_csv --create_plots
```

**Analysis Methods**:
- Correlation analysis for H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H8
- Variance analysis for H1, H4
- Regression analysis for all hypotheses
- Statistical significance testing

### Phase 3: Validation (500+ games)
```bash
# Run targeted validation experiments

```

**Validation Focus**:
- Confirm significant findings
- Test edge cases
- Refine hypothesis parameters
