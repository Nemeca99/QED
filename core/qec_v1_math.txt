You’ll want the math that defines the *state space*, *entanglement mapping*, and *move propagation.*
Below are the minimal formal expressions needed to ground Quantum Entanglement Chess (QEC) in math.

### **1. Board and Pieces**

Let
[
B = {a1,\dots,h8}
]
be the set of 64 squares.

Each piece (p_i) has attributes
[
p_i = (t_i, c_i, s_i, e_i)
]
where

* (t_i) = type ∈ {K,Q,R,B,N,P},
* (c_i) = color ∈ {White, Black},
* (s_i) = current square ∈ B ∪ {∅ (if captured)},
* (e_i) = index of its entangled counterpart or ∅ if none.

---

### **2. Entanglement Functions (Dual Mapping)**

Define two one-to-one maps (kings excluded):
[
E_W : P_W^{pawn} \setminus \{p^W_{free}\} \rightarrow P_B^{\neg king}
]
[
E_B : P_B^{pawn} \setminus \{p^B_{free}\} \rightarrow P_W^{\neg king}
]
with exactly one free pawn per side (p^W_{free}, p^B_{free}). Both maps are injective and fixed unless broken.

Bijectivity over chosen codomains holds for the selected 7 targets per side, i.e.,
[
\forall p \in P_W^{pawn} \setminus \{p^W_{free}\}: E_W(p) \neq \text{null},\quad E_W^{-1}(E_W(p)) = p
]
and symmetrically for (E_B).

When a member of an entangled pair is captured or a pawn in the pair promotes, the corresponding link becomes null for both members:
[
E_W(p)=\text{null}\;\lor\;E_B(p)=\text{null}.
]

---

### **3. State Representation**

A board state (S_t) at ply (t) is
[
S_t = (P_t, E_t, \tau_t)
]
where (P_t) = set of living pieces with their positions,
(E_t) = current entanglement mapping,
(\tau_t \in {W,B}) = side to move.

The complete game is a sequence
[
\Gamma = (S_0, S_1, \dots, S_T)
]
terminated by checkmate, dual-king condition, or draw.

---

### **4. Move Function (Single Forced Response)**

For a given state (S_t):

1. The active player chooses a legal classical move (m) for some piece (p).
2. If (p) is entangled via (E_W) or (E_B) to counterpart (q) and (q) has at least one legal move, exactly one forced move (m_q \in M(q,S_t)) is played by (q)'s owner during the same turn.
3. Apply both transformations to yield
   [
   S_{t+1}=T(S_t, m, m_q).\quad (\text{If no legal } m_q \text{ exists, omit it})
   ]

(T) enforces classical legality and king safety for both moves. Compound classical moves (e.g., castling) may relocate multiple pieces; only pieces that actually move and are entangled can trigger the single forced response.

---

### **5. Reactive-Check Function (Immediate One-Square Escape)**

Define a predicate
[
\text{Check}(S_t,,c)=
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if side } c \text{’s king is attacked}\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
]

If (\text{Check}(S_t,\text{defender})=1)
and there exists a legal one-square king move (m_K), apply the king's reactive move within the same turn before switching (\tau):
[
S_t' = T(S_t,m_K)
]
If no such (m_K) exists, checkmate occurs immediately.

---

### **6. State-Space Size**

Let (|S|) ≈ (4.6 × 10^{46}) (classical estimate).
QEC adds fixed dual mappings of at most 7 links per side. For a given selection of 7 targets per side, the mapping count is bounded by (7!)^2 (ignoring pre-game target subset selection and which pawns are free). Thus:
[
|S_{QEC}| \approx |S| \times (7!)^2 \quad \text{(upper bound over fixed target choices)}
]
This preserves finiteness; no continuous randomness is introduced.

Finite and enumerable; no continuous randomness.

---

### **7. Graph Representation**

Represent all positions as nodes (V=S).
Edges (E_{classical}) = legal single-move transitions.
QEC introduces a secondary edge set

[
E_{QEC} = {(s_i,s_j)\mid s_j = T(s_i,m,m_{E(m)})}
]

so the composite move graph is
[
G_{QEC}=(V,,E_{classical}\cup E_{QEC}).
]

---

### **8. Evaluation Functions (for AI)**

Sample heuristic:
[
f(S_t) =
\alpha M(S_t) +
\beta F(S_t) +
\gamma C(S_t)
]
where

* (M) = material differential,
* (F) = number of free (unentangled) pieces,
* (C) = king safety metric,
  and (\alpha,\beta,\gamma) are tunable weights.

---

### **9. Turn-Timer Constraint**

Each player’s decision time (Δt \leq 180 \text{s}).
Turn sequence:
[
t_{n+1}=t_n+1, \quad \tau_{t+1}= \neg\tau_t.
]

---

### **10. Theoretical Boundaries**

* Deterministic: (T) is a function, not a relation.
* Finite: (|S_{QEC}|<10^{52}).
* Terminating: captures and draws ensure (\exists T<∞.)
