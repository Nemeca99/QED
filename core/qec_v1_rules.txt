# **Quantum Entanglement Chess (QEC) – Formal Ruleset v1.0**

### **1. Overview**

Quantum Entanglement Chess (QEC) is a deterministic variant of classical chess.
All base chess rules—piece movement, board size, victory conditions—remain intact.
The variant introduces *entanglement links* between pieces of opposing sides, producing correlated movement and reactive play.

---

### **2. Board and Setup**

* Standard 8×8 chessboard, classical initial placement.
* All movement and captures follow orthodox chess mechanics unless modified below.
* Notation: standard algebraic notation is valid; additional notation specifies entanglement pairs (see §12).

---

### **3. Entanglement System**

**3.1 Initial Linking (Dual, 7-per-side)**

* Each **white pawn (7 of 8)** is entangled one-to-one with a **black non-king piece**; one white pawn is designated the **free pawn**.
* Each **black pawn (7 of 8)** is entangled one-to-one with a **white non-king piece**; one black pawn is designated the **free pawn**.
* Kings are never entangled.
* The mapping may be random, drafted, or pre-programmed before play. Once set, links are fixed unless broken (§3.4).

**3.2 Simultaneous Motion Rule (Single Forced Response)**
When any member of an entangled pair physically moves:

* Its linked counterpart must immediately make exactly one *legal* move.
* If no legal move exists, the counterpart remains stationary.
* If multiple legal moves exist, the owner of that counterpart selects the move (the mover never chooses the opponent’s move).
* This forced response is part of the same turn.

**3.3 Initiative and Turn Order**

* Standard alternating turns remain.
* Each player receives **3 minutes per turn.**
* There is no total game clock.

**3.4 Breaking Entanglement**

* If either member of an entangled pair is *captured,* that entanglement ceases for both.
* If a pawn promotes, both it and its linked piece become free (unentangled); no re-entangling occurs.
* Once freed, a piece never becomes re-entangled.

---

### **4. Reactive Check Rule (Immediate One-Square Escape)**

If a player delivers **check**, the opponent must immediately respond during the same turn:

* The checked king must attempt one *legal one-square* move to leave check.
* If no such move exists, **checkmate** occurs instantly.
* After this reactive move, play continues normally with the attacker’s next turn.

---

### **5. Win, Draw, and Loss Conditions**

* **Checkmate** – unchanged.
* **Draw** – both sides reduced to kings only ⇒ *both lose.*
* **Tournament format:** best-of-three series.

  * Two mutual losses ⇒ next round becomes single sudden-death game.
  * Prize rollover applies if all games drawn.

---

### **6. Timing Mechanics**

* Each player has **3 minutes per move.**
* Using the full timer effectively grants the opponent additional calculation time.
* Fast aggressive play compresses the opponent’s available thinking window.
* Strategic trade-off: deliberation vs. tempo denial.

---

### **7. Movement Dynamics**

* Exactly one forced entangled response may occur per turn, even if a classical move relocates multiple pieces (e.g., castling).
* During castling, only the rook’s relocation can trigger entanglement (the king is never entangled). If the castling rook is linked, the counterpart must make one legal move.
* Captures resolve in sequence of declaration: mover first, then forced counterpart.
* All resulting board positions must remain legal per classical rules, including king safety.

---

### **8. Strategy Inversion**

* **Pawns** become command units controlling opponent mobility.
* **Major pieces** act as expendable modifiers or entanglement breakers.
* Aggression relies on **counter-timing**, not first-move initiative.
* The second player gains informational advantage through reaction.

---

### **9. King Mobility and Defense**

* The king is reactive and mobile; can move defensively during opponent turns (§4).
* Check cycles can cause multi-piece movement per turn, producing high volatility.
* Mate occurs only when no reactive square remains.

---

### **10. Stalemate and Lock Prevention**

Entanglement ensures near-continuous motion:

* Forced movements often reopen blocked files or diagonals.
* Static positions (classical stalemates) are almost impossible.

---

### **11. LED / Digital Implementation (Optional Physical Form)**

* Each piece contains an indicator light or color tag.
* Linked pieces share color/ID number for entanglement visibility.
* Board may reveal all entanglements at start or keep them hidden until activation.

---

### **12. Notation System**

Extended algebraic notation:

```
e2-e4 [↔ h8R]
```

denotes a white pawn from e2 moved to e4, forcing entangled black rook (h8) to move.
If forced move is h8–h7:

```
e2-e4 [↔ h8R:h8-h7]
```

Captures that break entanglement append “✖”.

---

### **13. AI / Simulation Framework**

* State = standard FEN + entanglement mapping.
* Move generation = classical legal moves + forced entangled responses.
* Evaluation metrics: material, king safety, entanglement control, free-piece ratio.
* Game terminates upon classical mate or dual-king condition.

---

### **14. Theoretical Properties**

* Deterministic finite system; all positions are classical-legal.
* State space identical to chess; edge set expanded by entanglement relations.
* Optimal play equilibrium likely draw, but path volatility much higher.
* Skill emphasis: board-state memory, spatial reasoning, and timing management.

---

### **15. Educational Level and Accessibility**

* Requires knowledge of classical chess movement only.
* Distinct strategic framework; learning QEC does *not* confer standard chess strength.
* Recommended progression: Classical → QEC.

---

### **16. Design Goals**

1. Preserve chess determinism.
2. Introduce symmetric dependency and simultaneous motion.
3. Invert value hierarchy (pawns > majors).
4. Eliminate passive states.
5. Enable both physical and digital play.
